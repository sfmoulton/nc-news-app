# NC-News Project (Front-End)

The **NC-News App** has been created to allow users to read articles, add their comments, vote (either positively or negatively!) for a comment or article, and search for articles based on their favourite subject.

The app has been designed with UX front of mind - with clear text, display and buttons allowing the user to interact easily with the content. 

Prior to the creation of the Front-End App, the API Back-End was hosted using **Heroku**, which has been utilised by the app.
